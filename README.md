# üõ†Ô∏è **Team Git Workflow Instructions**

## Create a Feature Branch

- Start by pulling the latest version of the main branch to ensure your local repository is up to date.

- Create a new branch from main using a relevant name for the feature you're working on (e.g., git checkout -b feature-new-ui).

## Work on Your Feature

- Make the necessary changes and commit them regularly with clear messages (git commit -m "Implemented new UI layout").

- Push your branch to the remote repository (git push origin feature-new-ui).

## Submit a Pull Request (PR)

- Once your feature is complete and tested, navigate to the repository on GitHub (or whichever platform you‚Äôre using).

- Create a pull request (PR) from your feature branch into main, providing a clear description of the changes.

## Review & Merge

- We‚Äôll review the PR together and provide feedback and adjustments if needed.

- Once approved, the feature branch will be merged into main.

- After merging, everyone should pull the latest changes from main before starting any new work (git pull origin main).
